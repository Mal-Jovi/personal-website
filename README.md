This repo is for a static website that can query and return results for a given pokemon name.

The site is built with React.js and the Material-UI framework. It uses axios to interact with a RESTful API called PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) which is contains
a database for information on any pokemon. 

Once a name is searched, various details from the API query are then formatted are presented very efficiently with React.js and beautifully with the help of the Material-UI framework.

This React webapp is currently being hosted using netlify, you can try it out with the link below:
